#Toy

Description:
	This code is for a simple toy that I created for the MSP430 with the
	extension board containing a LCD display, buttons, and a buzzer. The
	toy makes sounds, lights up in patterns all controlled with the 4
	buttons on the extension board. 

How to compile it:
    In order to compile it, you need to download the project folder then run
    "make all" to compile the dependencies.

How to run it:
    After compiling, navigate to the 'toy' directory and run the cmd 'make
    load' to load the code onto the MSP430

How to use it:
    To use it, only interact with the buttons. The first button will play a
    sound with a specific light mode with 4 variations. The second button will
    reset everything. The third button will start a cycle on the lights. The
    fourth button will turn off the cycling of the lights.
